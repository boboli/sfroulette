# SF Roulette
This was a script I wrote back in 2019 to help me visit the neighborhoods of San Francisco when I first moved here. I wound up doing quite a few SF Roulette walks/photoshoots around golden hour/sunset time.

## How it works
1. The script will scrape this [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_neighborhoods_in_San_Francisco) using Wikipedia's API, and randomly give you a neighborhood.
2. You go there.
3. Take photos maybe?
